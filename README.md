# Digital Help Desk Receptionist

This is a thesis Project being developed by BSCS A students


## Get Started
To begin with, check the installation guide of [React Native Development Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

After following the instructions and making sure everything works fine, we may now proceed to the next step.

## Installation 

Clone the repository in git [Digital Help Desk Receptionist](https://github.com/Tordx/Digital-Receptionist.git)


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Tordx/Digital-Receptionist.git
```

Run [PowerShell]() as Administrator and direct to your repository folder.

Make sure to install all its dependency by running install.

```bash
$ yarn install
```
Clean android gradle by going to android folder and running command:

```bash
$ cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd..
```

## Start Coding

Make sure you are running the Emulator with SDKVersion 29, preferably Pixel C.

Run your code using the same [PowerShell]() by running this command:

```bash
$ npx react-native run-android
```
or
```bash
$ yarn run android
```

if [yarn run android]() is not recognized by your CLI, please run this command first:
```bash
$ set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
